          According to the quiz, my thinking style is firmly within the Abstract Sequential category.   While I really don't think that these thinking styles are as clear-cut as the internet/test makes them out to be, this would imply that I like to think about abstract and subtle things in a linear, logical manner.  So far I have found that applying a logical or linear framework to solving complex problems (one of the hallmarks of AS thinkers) is very well suited for computer science.  This is one explanation for why I have enjoy programming so much--I like coming up with solutions to logic puzzels.  Like typical AS thinkers, I enjoy stimulating work and I can work alone, both of which are beneficial in phase 0.

          One thing that has been difficult for me is sticking with the driver/navigator roles during pairing.  This makes sense within the context of my thinking style as I tend to dislike too many little rules/regulatins (ie:  don't touch the keyboard if you are navigating).  Also, working with people who view things differently AND can't give a logical explanation as to why can be frustrating.
