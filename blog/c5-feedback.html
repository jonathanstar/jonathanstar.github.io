    <h1>DBC Pairing and Feedback</h1>

    So far pairing has been a mixed bag for me.  I have had some very good pairing sessions and some where I feel that I could have got just as much or more from the exercise doing it myself.  Sometimes, pairing can be a good thing because it forces you to understand your code to the extent that you can esplain it to another person.  I am of the opinion that in most cases you don't fully understand something if you can't teach it.  I have found this to be a boon for learning stuff in many cases.  On the other hand, there are times where there are individual problems that I get held up on that my pair is able to solve.  While this is nice I also worry that I miss out on some of the learning process of figuring it out myself. I think that it is pretty much a wash from the perspective of learning stuff at the moment, but I suspect that as the concepts become more sophisticated and the work gets more complicated the benefits of working in pairs will far outweigh the detriments.

    The biggest problem that I have had so far is dealing with the driver/navigator dynamic with pairs who are going into DBC with less experience then me (I took an intro cs class in college whereas many in my cohort are programming for the first time).  Sometimes it can be frustrating if I know an answer that they are struggling on and I want to just jump in and type it but instead sometimes have to wait quite awhile for them to work it out.  I think that I need to focus more on taking out of it what I can from a learning perspective and being more patient with people who are newer to programming.  I will continue of course trying to be helpful whenever I can.  One thing that I really hate is feeling like a drag on people.

        Receiving feedback has been an interesting experience.  For the most part it has been pretty positive but when I do get negative feedback I tend to take it pretty personally.  One thing for me to work on is not to reject negative feedback in a knee jerk fashion and really work hard to avoid that initial instinct.  One pieve of feedback I have gotten is that I if I get stuck on things I tend to have a bit of tunnel vision in that I continue to work on that problem for too long when maybe it would be better to leave it and come back to it at the end/later with fresher eyes.  Another is that I should be more faithful to the driver/navigator roles and try not to let them bleed into each other too much.
    </p>

        The thing that has been most difficult for me writing feedback is definitely that I often don't have much to say.  Because it is so early in the program, some of these challenges go by without any real hiccups so sometimes I just have no relevant feedback to give, particularly constructive feedback.

    See you next time!
