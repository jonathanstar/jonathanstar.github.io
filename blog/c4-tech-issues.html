          With an ever increasing amount of personal information used, stored, and stolen from the web it is more important than ever to be mindful of security.  This post will cover two factor authentication, or 2fa.  Two factor authentication, as you might expect, requires two components for authentication.

          The idea behind two factor identification is that if one component is compromised, the other is likely to remain secure.  For example, if your debit card is stolen from your wallent, the theif is unlikely to also know your pin code.  The two factors can be anything, including physical objects, pin codes, passwords, your thumb, etc.  One popular use of 2FA is to have a users mobile phone as one of the factors for two factor authentication.  The idea is that users are likely to carry their phones around them all the time anyways, and so are not inconvenienced the way they would be by having to carry around a debit card, thumb drive, or other physical object.  In some ways this is a nice way around the inherent conflict between security and convenience.  One of the nice features of using mobile devices for two factor authentication is that they allow for dynamically generated passwords.  For example, in order to access a website, a user might need to reply to an email or text, which may have a  password (hidden from the view of the user) embedded inside of it.  This approach allows the website to change passwords as often as they like, keeping it more secure.  Of course there are downsides as well.  For example, text messages could be intercepted, or a user might forget their phone that day, or might not wish to pay to send a text.
