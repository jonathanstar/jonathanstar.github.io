     I am generally very excited about the DBC experience.  At the same time, however, I am a bit apprehensive as the amount of self directed learning will be very new to me.  For the most part my education has consisted of structured classes where there have been clear goals about what to learn and what not to learn.  The two exceptions to that for me were thesis and a seminar class where each week the student would prepare a lecture on that weeks topic.  While I really enjoyed both of these classes, both still had a considerable amount of guidance (in particular a professor helping to suggest topics, directing me to resources, etc).  In some senses DBC should be similar, but I expect it to be less and less structured as time goes on.  Both of these classes also involved me making decisions individually about what I would like to study rather then group decisions.  The group decision process will be entirely new to me.

     I'm not sure whether this will be easy or difficult to adapt to.  My hope is that I will have enough enthusiasm, initiative, and guidance to move in an interesting direction and contribute something cool to the educational experiment that is DBC.  I also hope that those in my cohort push me in new and interesting directions.  It will certainly be a new experience, but I think it will be a good one.
