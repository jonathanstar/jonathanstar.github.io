    <h1>Ruby vs. Javascript</h1>

          I'm pretty rushed so I am going to keep this one very short.  Javascript is no Ruby, that's for sure.  That is to say that after this week's introduction to Javascript, I am quite nostalgic for Ruby and its amazingly simple, flexible, easy syntax and available functions.  There are several main differences.
    </p>
    <p>
        The thing that sicks out in my mind the most is that Ruby just makes everything easy.  For example, Ruby has tons of built in methods to iterate through data structures like hashes and arrays.  You can always take an array or a hash and add a simple <code>.each</code>, <code>.map</code>, or some other nifty function to make things short and easy.  In Javascript, you need to get very verbose and constantly keep track of indeces or more likely (indeces-1).  There are not nearly as many cool, flexible methods that you can just pull out of a hat to solve your problem for you.  Another example is the <code>gets</code> function in Ruby.  It just makes everything so simple.  In Javascript you have to go through very elaborite gymnastics to just get a single line of input from the console.  Comparatively it is a complete pain.
    </p>
    <p>
        On a more basic (and probably important) level, Javascript and Ruby organize information differently.  Ruby, as you know, uses classes and objects can be created when you instantiate those classes.  In Javascript, there are objects, which are essentially structured like Ruby hashes.  A Javascrip object looks like this.
    </p>
    <div class="code-block">
      <code>
        var javascriptObject = {
        name: "Object Name",
        age: 24,
        boolean: true,          
        }

        javascriptObject.name
        //=> "Object Name"
      </code>
    </div>
    <p>
        There are also functions, which are basically similar to ruby methods in so far as they are blocks of code that can be reused.  To make multiple objects, you use a constructor function, which is basically just a block of code that creates an object inside of it.  
    </p>
    <p>
    Thats all for now.  Sorry its so short, I'm a bit pressed for time.  See you next time.
