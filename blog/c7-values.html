          When I think about values that are important to me I would say that I place a few things very highly:  being genuine, loyalty, intellectual status, and goodness (as a human being).  I think that I try to live up to all of these things in my own way, though certainly I fall short far more often than I would like.  It isn't that these are the only important qualities, but they are qualities that I strive for and look for in others.  There is just a kind of diginity that comes with these qualities (intellectual status less so) that I really admire.

          I don't know that I will have a problem with the stereotype threat at DBC (I really expect to) but if anything helped out I think it would be being genuine.  As for feeling down, I think the two things that help me with that most (in order?) are physical exercise and having a sense of accomplishment.  Endorphins are really powerful in how they affect my mood.

    That's all for now.  See you next time.
