          One conflict I have had is when I was travelling with my sister she would insist on micromanaging our schedules to a high extent while I preferred to be a bit more flexible.  I get along just fine with many different types of people and didn't mind her scheduling her time in a strict fasion but I did mind when she got angry at me if/when we were  unable to do the various things on her schedule.  On a basic level, this was very annoying and made me angry.  To be more specific, I found this extremely frustrating because I had put a lot of effort specifically into accomedating her style of travel and I felt that this effort went unrecognized when she blamed me if her plans didn't work out.  In the end we dealt with this by just splitting up at various points and doing a few solo travel days.  I learned from this that putting effort in isn't always enough, sometimes dealing with people can just be difficult and if you are with someone for long enough inevitably you will have problems.  Sometimes the answer is just to have a bit more space.  If I could go back and do it over again I probably would have communicated a bit more and planned for some of these problems by specifying solo travel days.
