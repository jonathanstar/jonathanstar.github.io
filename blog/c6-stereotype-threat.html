    <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>

        The stereotype threat is the mechanism by which it is believed that people underperform in response to awareness of negative stereotypes about their demographic group.  Current thinking is that the stereotype threat is related to a sort of subconcious anxiety around confirming a negative stereotype. There are quite a few interesting studies which support the existence of the stereotype threat which I would like to mention here.

    <p>
        The idea of stereotype threat was first introduced by Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson in a 1995 study called <span class="italics"> Stereotype Threat and the Intellectual Test Performance of African Americans</span>.  The study participants were given a test, and half were told that the test was a “a genuine test of verbal abilities and limitations” due to “various personal factors involved in performance” while the other half were simply told that the test comprised a set of verbal problems.  The results were that in the control group (non-diagnostic) black students scored similarly to whites (no statistically significant differences in the scores), but when students were made to think that the score was based on personal intellect, black students scored significantly worse than whites and completed the test more slowly.

        Another cool study entitled <span class="italics">Where are the Gender Differences? Male Priming Boosts Spatial Skills in Women</span>, participants were told that they would be tested on their ability to empathize and were randomly read a story about either the typical day of a stereotypical man or a stereotypical woman.  These stories were to prime the subjects with a particular gender identity.  A little while after being asked to describe the typical day the participants were asked to participate in a test of their spacial reasoning.  Here are the results:

    <p>
        As you can see from the results, the difference that gender priming made in women on the spacial reasoning test is unbelivably large. There was also a difference in men as well.  While the study is not proof of the stereotype threat, it certainly presents evidence that being concious of stereotypes matter.

    One way to combat the stereotype threat is to be aware of it.  For more on this and the stereotype threat in general, as well as the source of my graphs, check out <a href="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/picture-yourself-as-a-stereotypical-male">this</a> article.  See you next time.
