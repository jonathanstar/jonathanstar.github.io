						Hello, and welcome to my website.  My name is Jonathan Star and I am from Chicago, Illinois.  I recently graduated from <a href="http://www.cmc.edu/">Claremont Mckenna College</a> where I received a bachelor's in Mathematics.  Towards the end of my time in college I took a computer science class for my major and I discovered that I really enjoy programming.  To pursue this interest I am currently enrolled in Dev Bootcamp.  This site is an amalgamation of stuff about me, including my resume, projects that I have worked on, my (brand new) blog, and other stuff that I find cool.  
						<br>
						<br>
						In my spare time I enjoy skiing, chess, reading, rock climbing, tennis, and squash as well as watching NBA basketball.  I hope you enjoy this site, which I trust will be the first of many that I create.
